# About this app:

 This app is about a React Front End project and also approach a basic CRUD to be a little bit more dynamic.

 # How it works?

   Is very simple, you just have to assign your data to share, then click on save button or if it is wrong just click on clear inputs.
   Once you had put your data, on bottom of the page will have a pen, that is your data editor. Click on there to:
   
   - Edit your current data;
   - Delete your current data;

# BUT remind this:
    - if you type a user that's not on the list: you will have an error message on your screen.
